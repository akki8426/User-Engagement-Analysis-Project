## ⭐ Features / Highlights

### 🎯 Business Problem
In the restaurant business, understanding what drives customer engagement and how it impacts ratings and success is critical. This project investigates those relationships using real Yelp data.

### 📊 Key Questions Explored
- Which restaurants have the highest review counts and ratings?
- Is there a correlation between user engagement (reviews, tips, check-ins) and success metrics?
- How do elite users differ from regular users in terms of engagement?
- Are there consistent patterns in engagement over time for successful restaurants?
- What are the busiest hours for restaurants, and how can this guide operations?
- Does sentiment (“useful,” “funny,” “cool”) influence restaurant visibility and success?
- How do restaurant success metrics vary across cities and states?

### 🔍 Analysis Insights
- **Top-rated restaurants** don’t always have the most reviews — ratings and engagement aren’t always aligned.
- **Restaurants rated 4 stars** showed the **highest engagement** levels.
- Engagement metrics (tips, check-ins, reviews) are **positively correlated** — boosting one can improve the others.
- **Elite users** contribute disproportionately to reviews — engaging with them can drive loyalty and repeat visits.
- **Philadelphia, New Orleans, and Nashville** ranked highest in combined success metrics.
- **Peak hours for engagement:** 4 PM to 1 AM — critical for resource planning.
